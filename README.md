# yf-playground

# Project Description: 
This project is designed to retrieve and analyze stock data using the yfinance and pandas libraries. The goal of this project is to provide users with a simple and efficient way to retrieve and analyze historical stock data, which can be used to make informed investment decisions.
One of the main problems that this project solves is the difficulty of retrieving and analyzing stock data. Retrieving historical stock data can be time-consuming and require complex queries, while analyzing the data can require advanced statistical analysis and visualization tools.

# Features
The main features of this project include:
* Data Retrieval: This feature allows users to retrieve historical stock data for a specified set of tickers using the yfinance library. This data is then stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
* Data Analysis: This feature allows users to analyze the retrieved stock data using pandas' data manipulation and analysis tools. Users can filter, group, and aggregate the data to gain insights into trends and patterns.
* Interactive Visualizations: This feature allows users to create visualizations of the stock data using the pandas library. Users can create line charts, candlestick charts, and other types of visualizations to explore the data and identify trends.
* Statistical Analysis: This feature allows users to perform statistical analysis on the stock data using pandas' statistical functions. Users can calculate moving averages, exponential moving averages, and other statistical measures to better understand the data.

# Dependencies
The main libraries used in this project are:
* yfinance: A Python library that provides an easy-to-use interface to download historical market data from Yahoo Finance. We chose this library because it provides a simple way to retrieve stock data and has a wide range of data available.
* pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis. We chose this library for its powerful data analysis tools and ability to handle large datasets efficiently.

# Installation and running the project
To install and run this project on your local machine, you will need to have Python 3.10 installed as well as the yfinance and pandas libraries. You can install these dependencies using pip:

`pip install jupyter yfinance pandas`

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/aarong99/yf-playground.git`

Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and launch the notebook:

`cd <repository> jupyter notebook`

This will launch the Jupyter Notebook environment in your web browser. From there, you can open the notebook file and run each cell sequentially to retrieve and analyze stock data.

# Using the Notebook
To use this Jupyter Notebook project, users can open the notebook in their Jupyter environment after installing the required dependencies. To run the notebook, simply open it in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially. Users can modify the code and parameters as needed to analyze different stocks or timeframes. The notebook also includes markdown cells with explanations and instructions.

# Project Status: 
The development of this project is still in its early phases, and I am still in the requirements-definition and architecture-design stages. The code is still extremely drafty and unfit for production use, I am currently focusing on it and will update the repository as I go.
